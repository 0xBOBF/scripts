# chroot.sh 
#
# This script will set up bind mounts and an overlayfs for a chroot environment, and then start the chroot.
# 
# When you exit the chroot, this script will also clean up the binds and overlayfs for you.
#
# This is useful for making build environments that can be reset easily: After building, exit the chroot 
# and take what you need from the 'changes' directory. When you need a fresh build environment, just remove
# the changes directory run chroot.sh to start with a fresh build.
#
# You will need to make the 'rootfs' directory yourself by installing a valid OS there. For example, I use 
# a local copy of the slackware-current tree and install slackware using:
#
# installpkg --root /root/chroot-builds/rootfs /mnt/mirror/slackware64-current/slackware64/*/*.t?z
#
# Note that '/root/chroot-builds/' is where I keep and run the chroot.sh script, adjust as needed.
